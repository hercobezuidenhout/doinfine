    "question": "What is a fine?",
    "answer": "A fine is something you give someone when they do something that goes against the team's values, for example showing up late to a meeting or forgetting about t-shirt Friday. A fine does not necessarily have to be linked to a value. If you simply want your teammate to pay off a fine, you can then fine them for anything."

  {
    "question": "What is a payment?",
    "answer": "A payment is something someone does to pay off a fine. The payment method is an action which the team decides on and it is intended to be something fun and/or helpful towards the team. Payments are designed to help bring consequence to fines but also drive up the engagement in the team. Payments are not punishment for getting a fine! Rather, they should be used to bring enjoyment into the team."
